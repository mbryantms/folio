# Releasing Folio

Folio ships as two container images — `ghcr.io/<owner>/folio` (Rust server)
and `ghcr.io/<owner>/folio-web` (Next.js front) — published by
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml).

## The version is the Git tag

The crate and package manifests deliberately stay at `version = "0.0.0"`.
**A release is created by pushing an annotated `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag.**
There is no manifest version to bump — don't add one; it would contradict
this ritual and drift from the tag.

At image-build time the workflow passes the tag into the build as
`COMIC_BUILD_TAG`, and the server surfaces it at `GET /admin/server/info`
(see [`server_info.rs`](../../crates/server/src/api/server_info.rs)). A dev
build with no tag reports `dev`.

Pre-1.0 semver convention:

- **patch** (`v0.7.1` → `v0.7.2`) — bug fixes, polish, internal changes.
- **minor** (`v0.7.x` → `v0.8.0`) — user-facing features.
- **major** stays `0` until the 1.0 stabilization.

## What a tag push triggers

Pushing `vX.Y.Z` runs `release.yml`, which:

1. Builds + pushes both images to GHCR, tagged with the immutable
   `vX.Y.Z`, the floating `:latest` (non-prerelease only), plus
   `:sha-<short>`.
2. Attaches an SPDX SBOM and a keyless Sigstore (cosign) signature to each
   manifest.
3. Creates a GitHub Release whose body is the **`CHANGELOG.md` section for
   this version** followed by GitHub's auto-generated commit notes and the
   pull-from-GHCR + `cosign verify` snippets.

A push to `main` (no tag) publishes only the floating `:edge` / `:sha-<short>`
images — not a release.

## Cutting a release

Use the guard-railed recipe:

```sh
just release 0.7.2
```

It refuses to proceed unless the working tree is clean, you're on `main`, and
local `main` matches `origin/main` exactly — no unpushed commits, because `main`
is protected (strict checks + merge queue) and everything, including the
changelog, lands via a merged PR. It then verifies `CHANGELOG.md` already has a
**dated** `## [X.Y.Z]` section, runs the full check suite, creates the annotated
tag, and prints the push command — it does **not** push for you (pushing the tag
is the irreversible, image-publishing step, so it stays a deliberate manual
action).

### Before you run it

1. **Land all the work** for the release on `main` (via PRs / the merge queue).
2. **Land the changelog via its own PR.** `main` is protected, so the changelog
   commit can't be pushed straight to it. Open a `docs: changelog for vX.Y.Z`
   PR that moves items out of `## [Unreleased]` into a new, **dated**
   `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section (use today's date — the recipe no longer
   stamps it) and adds the `compare` link at the bottom, grouped under Added /
   Changed / Fixed / Removed. Merge it through the queue.
3. **Pull `main`** so it includes the merged changelog:
   `git checkout main && git pull`.
4. Sanity-check the diff that will ship: `git diff vLAST..HEAD --stat`.

### Manual fallback

If you're not using the recipe, the steps are:

```sh
# 1. Changelog via a PR — main is protected, so no direct push:
git checkout -b docs/changelog-vX.Y.Z
# edit CHANGELOG.md: new dated [X.Y.Z] section + compare link
git commit -am "docs: changelog for vX.Y.Z"
git push -u origin docs/changelog-vX.Y.Z
gh pr create --base main --fill        # then merge it via the queue

# 2. From an up-to-date main, tag and publish:
git checkout main && git pull
just check                             # full suite must be green
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z                 # ← the only direct push; triggers release
```

Branch protection covers `main`, not tags, so `git push origin vX.Y.Z` is the
one push allowed directly — and it's what publishes the release.

## Good release notes

Notes are assembled from two sources, so both matter:

- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — the curated, human-written highlights. This is the
  top of the GitHub Release body. Keep entries user-facing and grouped.
- **Commit messages** — GitHub auto-appends a commit/PR list. Write
  conventional-ish subjects (`feat(scope): …`, `fix(scope): …`) so the
  auto-generated portion reads well.

## Rollback

Images are immutable per tag; you can't overwrite a published `vX.Y.Z`.
To "roll back" a bad release, cut a new patch tag with the fix and move
deployments to it. A pushed tag can be deleted (`git push origin :vX.Y.Z`)
but any already-pulled images persist — prefer rolling forward.
